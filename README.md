# Pixi-demo

A simple demo about PIXI.js.

## Overview

An insanely short PIXI.js demo about loading resources (images), managing textures, creating sprites, and modifying them.

This is only about view, aka, there's no game logic.
Simply each 300 ms we pick a random tile and change it's texture to a random one.

## Usage

Start the app, it defaults to localhost:8080.
Index will be loaded automatically which contains the PIXI related example.
